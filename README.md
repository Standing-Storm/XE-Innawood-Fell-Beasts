# XedraWood: Fell Beasts
Adds more dangerous supernatural (or super-science) monsters to XedraWood, natural, supernatural, and preternatural.

Examples include: triffids who can control plants, mi-go psychics, strange lights in the swamps. 

Best if also run with Megafauna for that prehistoric theme, but it's not required.
